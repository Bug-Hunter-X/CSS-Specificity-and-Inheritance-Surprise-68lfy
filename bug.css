The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is unexpected */
}
```

The issue is that `div p` is more specific than `div` or `p` alone. It inherits `color: blue` from the `div` selector, and then overrides it with `color: green` due to higher specificity.  The unexpected part is the inheritance behavior. Often, developers expect the `div p` rule to simply override the `p` rule, ignoring the `div`'s inherited property.  The inheritance isn't inherently wrong, but it can lead to unexpected behavior if not considered.

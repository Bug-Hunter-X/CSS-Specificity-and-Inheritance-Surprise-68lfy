To solve this issue and make the CSS behavior more predictable, we can use the `!important` flag (though this should be used sparingly) or restructure the CSS for clarity:

**Method 1: Using `!important` (Use cautiously):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red !important; /* Force p to be red regardless of other rules */
}

div p {
  color: green;
}
```

**Method 2: Restructuring CSS for Clarity:**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.specific-paragraph {
  color: green; /* More descriptive selector */
}
```

Then, use the class `specific-paragraph` where you need the green color. This approach is generally preferred because it enhances readability and maintainability.
